# Multiple Switches and LEDs Interfacing with Arduino

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
In embedded systems and microcontroller applications, interfacing switches and LEDs is a fundamental task.  
This project demonstrates basic digital input and output operations using an Arduino.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
**Objective:** Connect 2 LEDs to separate slide-switch controls using an Arduino.  
Each LED should be controlled independently based on the state of its switch.

## ðŸ›  Required Components
- Arduino Uno R3
- Breadboard
- Slide Switches (x2)
- LEDs (x2)
- Resistors (220Î© â€“ 1kÎ©, x2 for LEDs)
- Jumper Wires

## âš¡ Connections
**LEDs**
- LED 1: Anode â†’ Digital Pin 12 via resistor, Cathode â†’ GND  
- LED 2: Anode â†’ Digital Pin 13 via resistor, Cathode â†’ GND  

**Slide Switches**
- Switch 1: One terminal â†’ 5V, Other terminal â†’ Digital Pin 2 (with pull-down resistor if needed)  
- Switch 2: One terminal â†’ 5V, Other terminal â†’ Digital Pin 3 (with pull-down resistor if needed)  

## ðŸ“– Working Principle
- Switch 1 controls LED 1 independently.  
- Switch 2 controls LED 2 independently.  
- LEDs turn ON when their respective switches are HIGH, and OFF when LOW.  
- Debouncing ensures stable switch operation.  

## âœ… Summary
This project explains how two switches can independently control two LEDs using Arduino.  
It forms the foundation for:
- Control panels  
- User interfaces  
- Interactive embedded systems
